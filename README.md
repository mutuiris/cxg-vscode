# Context eXtended Guard (cxg)

**cxg** is an intelligent VS Code extension that protects developers from accidentally exposing sensitive information when using AI assistants. Built with computing and machine learning, cxg intercepts, analyzes, and sanitizes code before it reaches AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Claude.

## Vision

Enable developers to safely leverage AI assistance without compromising intellectual property, secrets, or competitive advantages. cxg makes AI assisted development secure by default, allowing developers to get help while protecting their most valuable code assets.

## Core Features

- **Real-time Code Analysis**: Sub-100ms analysis with 95%+ accuracy for secret detection
- **Universal AI Integration**: Works seamlessly with all major AI assistants and tools
- **Edge-First Architecture**: Global performance with 330+ edge locations via Cloudflare
- **Offline-Capable**: Local SQLite cache and WASM analysis engine for zero-latency protection
- **Smart Sanitization**: Context-preserving code transformations that maintain functionality
- **Zero-Trust Security**: End-to-end encryption with privacy-by-design architecture

## How It Works

### 1. Code Interception
When you copy code to share with an AI assistant, cxg automatically intercepts and analyzes it.

### 2. Intelligent Analysis
cxg analyzes the code through multiple detection layers:
- **Lexical Analysis**: Pattern matching for known secret formats
- **AST Analysis**: Structural understanding of code context
- **Semantic Analysis**: Business logic and data flow understanding
- **ML Inference**: Advanced pattern recognition using trained models

### 3. Smart Sanitization
```javascript
// Original code:
const config = {
  apiKey: 'sk-1234567890abcdef',
  databaseUrl: 'postgresql://user:pass@internal-db:5432/prod'
};

// Sanitized version:
const config = {
  apiKey: 'REDACTED_API_KEY',
  databaseUrl: 'postgresql://user:pass@REDACTED_HOST:5432/REDACTED_DB'
};
```

### 4. Safe AI Interaction
The sanitized code is sent to your AI assistant, allowing you to get help while protecting sensitive information.

## Performance Targets

- **Analysis Speed**: <100ms for most operations
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ for secret detection, <10% false positives
- **Global Coverage**: Sub-50ms response times worldwide
- **Offline Support**: Full functionality without internet connection

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- VS Code 1.80.0 or higher
- Node.js 18+ (for development)

### Installation

Currently in development. Installation will be available via:

1. **VS Code Marketplace** (coming soon)
2. **Manual Installation** from releases
3. **Development Build** from source

### Development Setup

#### From GitHub

1.  Clone the repository and its submodules:
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mutuiris/cxg-vscode.git
    cd cxg-vscode
    ```
    If you have already cloned the repository, initialize the submodule with:
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

2.  Run the setup script to install dependencies and configure the environment:
    ```bash
    node scripts/dev/setup.js
    ```
    This script will install all Node.js and Go dependencies and prepare your local configuration.

3.  Start the development environment:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

4.  Open the `cxg-vscode` folder in VS Code and press `F5` to launch the extension in a new development host window.


## Detection Capabilities

### JavaScript/TypeScript Focus
- Environment variables and API keys
- Database connection strings
- Authentication tokens and secrets
- Framework-specific patterns (React, Node.js, Express)
- Business logic and proprietary algorithms
- Internal service configurations

### Multi-Language Support (Planned)
- Python, Java, Go, C#, PHP
- Language-specific secret patterns
- Framework detection across ecosystems


## Performance Benchmarks

### Analysis Performance
| Operation | Local Cache | Edge Analysis | Backend Deep Scan |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Secret detection | <5ms | <50ms | <200ms |
| Business logic analysis | <10ms | <100ms | <500ms |
| Full file scan (1000 lines) | <25ms | <150ms | <1000ms |
| Workspace scan (100 files) | <500ms | <5s | <30s |

### Accuracy Metrics
| Pattern Type | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| API keys/tokens | 97% | 94% | 95.5% |
| Database credentials | 95% | 92% | 93.5% |
| Business logic | 85% | 78% | 81.3% |
| Infrastructure details | 88% | 83% | 85.4% |

### Memory Usage
- Extension overhead: <50MB
- Local cache: <100MB
- Analysis models: <15MB
- Total footprint: <165MB
